# 2D-Clicker-Game
My inaugural Unity project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a game developer. Prior to embarking on this endeavor, I possessed no prior knowledge or experience in game development. Every aspect of this project, from its inception to its completion, has been guided by meticulously following tutorials available on YouTube. This achievement serves as a testament to my resourcefulness and ability to acquire new skills through self-directed learning.
